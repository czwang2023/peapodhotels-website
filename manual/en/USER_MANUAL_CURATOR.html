<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>No Draft Status:</strong> Hosts create listings locally on their device. Once submitted, listings go directly to “Pending Review” status. There is no draft state in the database.</p>
<p><strong>Active Listings with Pending Edits:</strong> When a host edits critical information on an active listing (bedrooms, bathrooms, capacity, property type, etc.), the listing <strong>stays active and bookable</strong>. Guests continue to see the old curator-approved information until you approve the changes. This protects guests from seeing unverified changes. See section 7.4.4 for the edit review workflow.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Complete Review Workflow for NEW Listings:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Host submits NEW listing</strong> → Status: <strong>Pending Review</strong> → Appears in your “New Listing Approvals” queue</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You review</strong> → Three paths:</p>
<p><strong>Path A: Request Edits (Fixable Issues)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You select “Request Changes” → Status: <strong>Request Edits</strong></li>
<li>Host receives detailed feedback</li>
<li>Host makes improvements and resubmits immediately → Status: <strong>Pending Review</strong> (back to you)</li>
<li>You review again → Approve or Request more changes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Path B: Approve (Quality Standards Met)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You select “Approve” → Status: <strong>Active</strong></li>
<li>Listing goes live immediately</li>
<li>Guests can search and book</li>
<li>You can monitor for future issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Path C: Reject (Serious Issues)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You select “Reject” → Status: <strong>Rejected</strong></li>
<li>Host receives detailed rejection reason</li>
<li><strong>Host can fix issues and resubmit immediately</strong> (no waiting period)</li>
<li>Or host can appeal via chat if they believe rejection was a mistake</li>
<li>Rejection is for this specific listing submission, not permanent ban</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Active Listing Monitoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you find issue with live listing → Pause it → Status: <strong>Paused by Curator</strong></li>
<li>Host must fix issue and request re-review → Status: <strong>Pending Review</strong> (back to you)</li>
<li>You review fixes → Approve to make Active again</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Your Two Core Actions Explained:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Request Edits” = Fixable Issues</strong> ✏️ Use for quality improvements needed: - Poor photo quality or insufficient count - Description too brief or missing details - Incomplete amenities list - Unclear house rules - Pricing needs adjustment - Location details incomplete</p>
<p><strong>“Reject” = Serious Issues</strong> ❌ Use for issues that need significant fixes before approval: - Fraudulent listing (fake photos, property doesn’t exist) - Illegal activity or policy violations - Duplicate listing already on platform - Safety hazards that cannot be remediated - Property not suitable for platform - Wrong platform (commercial property, hotel, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>After Rejection:</strong> - <strong>Host can fix issues and resubmit immediately</strong> - No waiting period, no penalty - Host can appeal via chat if they believe rejection was a mistake - You can review appeal and reconsider if issues were misunderstood - Rejection is for this specific submission, not a permanent ban on the property</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Step 3: Decision</strong></p>
<p>Choose one of three actions:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Approve Listing ✅</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to Approve:</strong> 1. Verify all checklist items pass quality standards 2. Tap “Approve” button (green) 3. Confirmation alert appears: “Approve this listing?” 4. Tap “Confirm” 5. Listing status changes to “Active” 6. Host receives approval notification immediately 7. Listing appears in search results immediately 8. Your review count increments</p>
<p><strong>When to Approve:</strong> - All quality standards met - Photos are professional and accurate - Description is detailed and helpful - No safety concerns - Amenities accurately represented - Pricing is competitive</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Option 2: Request Changes 🟧</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to Request Changes:</strong> 1. Identify specific quality issues that need improvement 2. Tap “Request Changes” button (orange) 3. <strong>Use Improvement Templates 2.0:</strong> - Select predefined issue categories - Choose modular feedback blocks: - <strong>Photo Feedback Block</strong> - “Add at least 3 photos per bedroom with good lighting” - <strong>Description Feedback Block</strong> - “Add details about nearby attractions and neighborhood” - <strong>Safety Feedback Block</strong> - “Include visible smoke detector or first aid kit in photos” - <strong>Amenity Feedback Block</strong> - “Verify all listed amenities are visible in photos” - <strong>Pricing Feedback Block</strong> - “Adjust pricing to align with comparable properties in area” - Combine multiple blocks as needed 4. Add custom comments for specific issues not covered by templates 5. Tap “Send Feedback to Host” 6. Listing status changes to “Changes Requested” 7. Host receives notification with detailed feedback</p>
<p><strong>Common Issues to Request Changes:</strong> - <strong>Photos need improvement:</strong> - Not enough photos (minimum 5, recommend 15-20) - Poor lighting or blurry images - Missing key rooms (bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen) - Need exterior shots - <strong>Description too short:</strong> - Less than 500 words - Missing neighborhood information - No mention of nearby attractions - Lacks unique property features - <strong>Missing amenities:</strong> - Claimed amenities not visible in photos - Incomplete amenity list - No mention of WiFi, parking, or kitchen - <strong>Pricing unclear:</strong> - No cleaning fee listed - Discount structure confusing - Significantly above/below market rate - <strong>House rules incomplete:</strong> - No check-in/check-out times - Missing pet policy - No smoking policy stated - Quiet hours not specified - <strong>Location issues:</strong> - Map pin incorrect - Address incomplete - Parking instructions missing - <strong>Safety concerns:</strong> - No visible smoke detectors - Potential hazards in photos - Missing emergency contact info</p>
<p><strong>Feedback Best Practices:</strong> - ✅ Be specific (e.g., “Add photos of bedroom” not “Need more photos”) - ✅ Be constructive and helpful - ✅ Explain why change is needed - ✅ Provide examples if possible - ✅ Use templates for efficiency and consistency - ✅ Attach reference photos if helpful - ❌ Don’t be vague or generic - ❌ Don’t use harsh language - ❌ Don’t reject when changes would suffice</p>
<p><strong>Host Feedback System:</strong> After host resubmits, they can rate your feedback clarity (1-5⭐). This helps improve your curator performance and guides future feedback quality.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Option 3: Reject Listing ❌</strong></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: Use Rejection Thoughtfully!</strong> Most issues can be fixed through “Request Changes”. Use rejection for serious issues that require significant fixes before approval.</p>
<p><strong>How to Reject:</strong> 1. Determine listing has serious issues (see rejection reasons below) 2. Tap “Reject” button (red) 3. Select rejection reason from dropdown (matches categories below) 4. Write detailed explanation (required, minimum 100 words): - Explain specifically what is wrong - Reference evidence (specific photos, descriptions, etc.) - Explain what needs to be fixed - Inform host they can resubmit immediately after fixing issues 5. Tap “Confirm Rejection” 6. Confirmation alert: “Are you sure you want to reject?” 7. Tap “Confirm” 8. Listing status changes to “Rejected” 9. Host receives notification with detailed reason 10. Host can fix issues and resubmit immediately (no waiting period)</p>
<p><strong>Rejection Reasons Taxonomy:</strong></p>
<p>Only reject for these fundamental problems:</p>
<p><strong>1. Fraudulent Listing 🚨</strong> - Stock photos or images stolen from other websites - Photos clearly from different properties - Property doesn’t exist at stated address - Verified scam indicators - Host using fake identity or stolen credentials - <em>Example: “Photos are stock images from Shutterstock, not actual property”</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Illegal Activity or Policy Violations ⚖️</strong> - Illegal short-term rental in jurisdiction that bans them - Property used for illegal purposes mentioned in listing - Discriminatory policies violating fair housing laws - Adult-only content or services - Promotes illegal activities - <em>Example: “City has ban on short-term rentals; cannot approve”</em></p>
<p><strong>3. Duplicate Listing 🔁</strong> - Property already listed on Peapod under different account - Same host has listed same property multiple times - Verified to be existing active listing - <em>Example: “This property already exists as Listing #12345”</em></p>
<p><strong>4. Property Not Available ❌</strong> - Property is not actually available for rent - Under construction or renovation indefinitely - Owner does not have authority to rent - Property is condemned or uninhabitable by law - <em>Example: “Building permit shows property condemned by city”</em></p>
<p><strong>5. Wrong Platform / Property Type 🏢</strong> - Commercial property (office, retail, warehouse) - RV, boat, or vehicle (not traditional housing) - Time-share or fractional ownership - <em>Example: “This is a commercial office space, not residential”</em></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Hotels, Hostels, Boutique Hotels, and Resorts are <strong>now supported</strong> on Peapod with multi-unit room/bed types. See Section 7.4.5 for review guidelines specific to these property types.</p>
<p><strong>6. Unremediated Safety Hazards ⚠️</strong> - Severe structural damage visible in photos - Electrical hazards that pose immediate danger - Toxic mold or environmental contamination - Building code violations that cannot be fixed - Unsafe location with documented crime issues - <em>Example: “Visible exposed wiring and ceiling collapse in photos”</em></p>

<p><strong>Resubmission &amp; Appeal Process:</strong> - <strong>Host can resubmit immediately after fixing issues</strong> - No waiting period, no penalty - Host receives detailed feedback explaining what needs to be fixed - After fixing issues, host can resubmit for review - Listing returns to “Pending Review” status in your queue - You review the fixes and approve or provide additional feedback - <strong>Appeal Option:</strong> If host believes rejection was a mistake, they can message you via chat - You can reconsider if there was a misunderstanding - If rejection stands, explain clearly why and what needs to change</p>
<p><strong>Documentation Requirements:</strong> When rejecting, document evidence: - Screenshot specific photos showing fraud/issues - Note specific policy violations - Reference comparable listings for duplicates - Cite building codes or regulations if applicable - Save all documentation in case of appeal</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="reviewing-edits-to-active-listings-three-tier-system">7.4.4 Reviewing Edits to Active Listings: Three-Tier System</h4>
<p>Once a listing is approved and active, hosts can make edits. The system automatically categorizes edits by urgency and routes them appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Active listings stay visible and bookable even with pending critical edits. Guests see the old curator-approved information until you approve changes. This protects guests from seeing unverified updates.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Edit Categories and Your Role:</strong></p>
<p><strong>🔴 Critical Edits (Require Your Approval)</strong></p>
<p>These fundamentally define what guests are booking. Changes require your approval before going live.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Property type (House → Apartment) - Number of bedrooms - Number of bathrooms - Max guest capacity - Location/Address - Major amenities (Pool, Hot tub, Parking, AC/Heating, Kitchen, Washer/Dryer, Accessibility features)</p>
<p><strong>What Happens:</strong> 1. Host makes critical change (e.g., bedrooms 2 → 3) 2. Listing stays <strong>Active</strong> - Guests still see old approved data (2 bedrooms) 3. Edit appears in your <strong>“Edit Reviews”</strong> queue with <strong>“Critical”</strong> badge 4. You receive notification: “Critical edit awaiting review” 5. You review within 24 hours (SLA)</p>
<p><strong>Your Decision:</strong> - <strong>Approve:</strong> Changes go live immediately, guests now see new information (3 bedrooms) - <strong>Reject:</strong> Listing stays with old information (2 bedrooms), host sees rejection reason and can resubmit immediately</p>
<p><strong>Review Process:</strong> 1. Open edit from “Edit Reviews” queue 2. See side-by-side comparison: - <strong>Old:</strong> 2 bedrooms (currently shown to guests) - <strong>New:</strong> 3 bedrooms (proposed change) 3. Verify claim matches photos/reality 4. Tap “Approve” or “Reject” with reason 5. Edit record updated, host notified</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If guest books during pending period, they book based on OLD approved information (e.g., 2 bedrooms). Host must honor what guest booked. After you approve, future bookings show new information.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>✅ Auto-Approved Changes (No Review Needed)</strong></p>
<p>All other changes go live immediately without your review.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Photos/Videos - Title changes - Description changes - Price changes - Cleaning fee adjustments - Cancellation policy changes - Minimum/maximum stay requirements - Minor amenity additions/removals</p>
<p><strong>What Happens:</strong> 1. Host makes medium priority change (e.g., price $200 → $250) 2. Change goes live <strong>immediately</strong> 3. Listing stays <strong>Active</strong> 4. Guests see new information right away ($250) 5. Edit appears in your <strong>“Weekly Review Queue”</strong> for async review 6. You review during weekly quality check 7. If issue found, you message host to adjust</p>
<p><strong>Your Role:</strong> - Review weekly (not urgent) - Check for quality issues - Message host if adjustments needed - Auto-marked as reviewed after 7 days if no action</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>🟢 Low Priority Edits (No Review Needed)</strong></p>
<p>Operational details that don’t affect booking decisions. Updates go live immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> - WiFi password - Door codes/check-in instructions - Local recommendations - Neighborhood guide - Parking instructions - Trash/recycling info - Calendar availability</p>
<p><strong>What Happens:</strong> 1. Host makes low priority change 2. Change goes live <strong>immediately</strong> 3. No curator review needed 4. Logged in audit trail for compliance</p>
<p><strong>Your Role:</strong> - No action required - System handles automatically</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Your Two Queues as a Curator:</strong></p>
<p>Both queues are accessible from the <strong>Listings tab</strong> with filters or separate sections:</p>
<p><strong>1. New Listing Approvals</strong> - New listings in “Pending Review” status - Listings in “Request Edits” status (resubmissions) - Listings you paused (“Paused by Curator” status)</p>
<p><strong>2. Edit Reviews</strong> - Critical edits to active listings requiring approval - Organized by urgency and age (oldest critical first) - Auto-approved edits do not appear here (they go live immediately)</p>
<p><strong>Listings Tab Features:</strong> - <strong>Stats:</strong> Total pending, Critical count, Medium count, Oldest age - <strong>Filters:</strong> [New Listings] [Edit Reviews] or [All] [Critical] [Medium] - <strong>Edit Cards:</strong> Show listing name, host, category, changed fields, age - <strong>Badge:</strong> Tab shows combined count of pending new listings + critical edits</p>
<p><strong>Example Edit Card:</strong></p>
<pre><code>🔴 Downtown Loft · Host: Jane Smith
    Active listing · 3 days pending
    Changes: bedrooms (2 → 3)
    Category: CRITICAL
    [Review Changes →]</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>Review Best Practices:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Critical Edits:</strong> - ✅ Review within 24 hours (high priority) - ✅ Verify changes match photos - ✅ Check for fraud (e.g., claiming features that don’t exist) - ✅ Consider guest impact (bookings honored based on old data) - ✅ Approve quickly if changes are legitimate - ✅ Reject with clear reason if misleading</p>
<p><strong>Auto-Approved Changes:</strong> - ✅ No review needed - changes go live immediately - ✅ Monitor listings during regular quality checks - ✅ Message host if you notice quality issues - ✅ Pause listing if serious problems found</p>
<p><strong>Communication:</strong> - ✅ Explain why you rejected critical edit - ✅ Be specific about what needs verification - ✅ Host can resubmit immediately after fixing - ✅ Thank host for keeping listing up to date</p>

<h4 id="reviewing-multi-unit-properties-hotelshostelsboutique-hotelsresorts">7.4.5 Reviewing Multi-Unit Properties (Hotels/Hostels/Boutique Hotels/Resorts)</h4>
<p><strong>NEW IN SLICE V:</strong> Hotels, Hostels, Boutique Hotels, and Resorts now support multi-unit booking with room/bed types. This section covers special considerations when reviewing these property types.</p>

<p><strong>Key Difference:</strong> Unlike Houses/Apartments where guests book the entire property, Hotels/Hostels allow multiple guests to book different room/bed types on the same dates.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Validation Rule (REQUIRED):</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Multi-unit properties CANNOT be approved unless they have at least one active room/bed type.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What to Check:</strong> 1. Open the listing review 2. Scroll to <strong>“Room Types”</strong> or <strong>“Bed Types”</strong> section 3. Verify at least one room/bed type exists 4. If empty → <strong>Request Edits</strong> with message: &gt; “Your [Hotel/Hostel] listing requires at least one room or bed type before approval. Please add your room types in the listing editor under ‘Room Types’.”</p>

<p><strong>Two-Tier Amenities System:</strong></p>
<p>Multi-unit properties have two levels of amenities:</p>
<table>

<col style="width: 25%" />

<tr>
<td><strong>Shared Amenities</strong></td>
<td>Listing Editor → Amenities</td>
<td>All room types</td>
<td>Pool, Gym, Restaurant, Lobby WiFi</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Room-Type Amenities</strong></td>
<td>Room Type Editor</td>
<td>Specific room only</td>
<td>Balcony, Minibar, Private Bathroom</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>What to Verify:</strong> - ✅ Shared amenities are property-wide features (guests can access regardless of room type) - ✅ Room-type amenities are specific to that room/bed type - ❌ No duplication (if Pool is shared, shouldn’t be in each room type) - ❌ Room-type amenities shouldn’t include property features</p>
<p><strong>Search Impact (FYI):</strong> Guest searches match room types where <code>shared + room amenities</code> include all filtered amenities. If a guest filters for “WiFi + Balcony”, only room types with both (either shared or room-specific) will appear.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Photo Requirements for Multi-Unit:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Listing-Level Photos:</strong> - Exterior/building shots - Common areas (lobby, pool, restaurant, gym) - Shared facilities</p>
<p><strong>Room-Type Photos (Recommended):</strong> - Each room type should have representative photos - Show bed configuration, bathroom, amenities - Help guests distinguish between room types</p>
<p><strong>What to Check:</strong> - Listing has sufficient property photos (min 5) - Room types have photos OR host mentions “rooms similar to photos shown” - Photos match room type descriptions</p>

<h3 id="availability-management">7.7 Availability Management</h3>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Main tab → “Availability” (calendar icon)</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Manage your curator schedule, working hours, and capacity to prevent burnout and maintain quality reviews.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="review-capacity">7.7.1 Review Capacity</h4>
<p><strong>What You’ll See:</strong> - <strong>Review Capacity Card</strong> at top of Availability screen - Current status: “Available” (green) or “At Capacity” (red) - Daily capacity: Progress bar showing “3 / 5 reviews today” - Weekly capacity: Progress bar showing “12 / 25 reviews this week” - Edit button to adjust limits</p>
<p><strong>How Capacity Works:</strong> - System tracks how many listings you’ve reviewed today and this week - Daily limit: Default 5 reviews/day (range: 1-50) - Weekly limit: Default 25 reviews/week (range: 1-200) - Counts reset automatically: - Daily count resets at midnight - Weekly count resets every Monday - Status shows “At Capacity” when you reach either daily or weekly limit</p>
<p><strong>How to Edit Capacity:</strong> 1. Tap “Edit” button on Capacity Card 2. Sheet appears with sliders: - <strong>Max Reviews Per Day:</strong> Adjust slider (1-50) - <strong>Max Reviews Per Week:</strong> Adjust slider (1-200) - <strong>Alert Threshold:</strong> When to warn you (50%-100%, default 80%) 3. Tap “Save” 4. Capacity card updates with new limits</p>
<p><strong>Capacity Recommendations:</strong> - <strong>New curators:</strong> Start with 3-5 reviews/day, 15-20/week - <strong>Experienced curators:</strong> 8-10 reviews/day, 40-50/week - <strong>Leave buffer:</strong> Don’t max out - allow time for re-reviews and questions</p>
<p><strong>What Happens at Capacity:</strong> - Status badge turns red: “At Capacity” - System can use this for smart assignment (future) - You can still review listings (no enforcement) - Visual reminder to maintain quality over quantity</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="weekly-schedule">7.7.2 Weekly Schedule</h4>
<p><strong>What You’ll See:</strong> - <strong>Weekly Schedule</strong> section showing your working hours - List of days (Monday - Sunday) - Each day shows time range (e.g., “9:00 AM - 5:00 PM”) - Green checkmark for days with hours set - Empty state: “No schedule set. Tap Edit to add your working hours.”</p>
<p><strong>How to Set Your Schedule:</strong> 1. Tap “Edit” button in Weekly Schedule section 2. Sheet appears with day-by-day configuration 3. For each day: - Toggle “Available” on/off - If available, set: - <strong>Start Time:</strong> When you begin reviewing (e.g., 9:00 AM) - <strong>End Time:</strong> When you stop reviewing (e.g., 5:00 PM) 4. Tap “Save” 5. Schedule list updates with your hours</p>
<p><strong>Schedule Examples:</strong> - <strong>Full-time curator:</strong> Mon-Fri, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM - <strong>Part-time curator:</strong> Mon/Wed/Fri, 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM - <strong>Flexible curator:</strong> Mon-Sun, 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM - <strong>Weekend curator:</strong> Sat-Sun, 12:00 PM - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Why Set a Schedule:</strong> - Helps you maintain work-life balance - Future: Smart assignment can use this to assign during your hours - Visual reminder of your commitment level - Can adjust as needed (vacations, busy periods)</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong> - ✅ Be realistic - don’t overcommit - ✅ Include breaks between review sessions - ✅ Update schedule when circumstances change - ✅ Leave buffer time for host questions - ✅ Quality over quantity - better to review fewer listings well</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="time-off-management">7.7.3 Time Off Management</h4>
<p><strong>What You’ll See:</strong> - <strong>Time Off</strong> section listing your scheduled time-off periods - Each entry shows: - Date range (e.g., “Dec 24 → Dec 31”) - Reason (optional, e.g., “Holiday vacation”) - Duration (e.g., “7 days”) - Delete button (trash icon) - Empty state: “No time off scheduled.”</p>

<p><strong>What Happens During Time Off:</strong> - Currently: Visual reminder on your schedule - Future: Smart assignment will avoid assigning you listings during time-off - No impact on existing assigned listings (you should complete before time-off)</p>
<p><strong>Time Off Examples:</strong> - <strong>Vacation:</strong> Dec 20 - Dec 27 (7 days) - <strong>Conference:</strong> Mar 15 - Mar 17 (3 days) - <strong>Personal:</strong> Nov 5 (1 day) - <strong>Sick leave:</strong> Oct 12 - Oct 14 (3 days)</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong> - ✅ Add time-off well in advance (at least 1 week notice) - ✅ Complete pending reviews before time-off starts - ✅ Include reason for your own reference - ✅ Update if plans change (delete and re-add)</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="calendar-view-visual-schedule-new">7.7.4 Calendar View (Visual Schedule) ✨ NEW</h4>
<p><strong>What You’ll See:</strong> - <strong>Monthly calendar</strong> showing your availability at a glance - Each day color-coded: - <strong>Green:</strong> Working day with capacity available - <strong>Orange:</strong> Working day near/at capacity - <strong>Gray:</strong> Time-off or no working hours set - <strong>Blue highlight:</strong> Today - Small indicator showing reviews completed that day - Navigation: Previous/Next month buttons</p>

<p><strong>What Calendar Shows:</strong> - Visual overview of your availability - Time-off periods at a glance - Busy vs light days - Upcoming commitments</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="availability-check-for-future-smart-assignment">7.7.5 Availability Check (For Future Smart Assignment)</h4>
<p><strong>How System Uses Your Availability (Future Feature):</strong></p>
<p>When new listing submitted, system checks: 1. <strong>Does curator have working hours today?</strong> - Check weekly schedule - If Monday and curator works Mon 9am-5pm → Yes</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Is curator on time-off?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Check time-off table</li>
<li>If today is between start_date and end_date → No assignments</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Is curator at capacity?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Check daily/weekly review counts</li>
<li>If 5/5 daily or 25/25 weekly → At capacity</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> - <code>isAvailable = true</code> → Curator can receive assignments - <code>isAvailable = false</code> → Skip this curator, check next</p>
<p><strong>Future: Smart Assignment Algorithm:</strong> - Only assign to available curators - Distribute workload fairly - Match specialization (property type, location) - Respect capacity limits - Honor time-off periods</p>
<p><strong>Currently:</strong> - Availability system exists and works - You can set schedule, capacity, time-off - Smart assignment not yet implemented - Manual assignment still used</p>

<p><strong>Critical Edit Reviews (24h target / 48h max)</strong> - Active listings with pending edits need quick approval - Guests may be booking based on old data - Approve or reject within 24 hours</p>
<p><strong>Re-submission Reviews (24h target / 48h max)</strong> - Host already invested time making requested changes - Prioritize over new submissions - Fast turnaround encourages host engagement</p>
<p><strong>Safety/Abuse Reports (4h target / 8h max)</strong> - 🚨 <strong>URGENT:</strong> These protect guests and platform integrity - Examples: Fraudulent listing, safety hazard discovered, abuse reported - Drop everything to address safety issues - Escalate immediately if unsure</p>
<p><strong>Dispute Resolution (24h target / 48h max)</strong> - Host appeals rejection or requests reconsideration - Review appeal with fresh perspective - Respond with clear reasoning</p>

<li><strong>At 8 hours (Safety/Abuse):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Admin receives urgent notification</li>
<li>Task escalated to Admin queue</li>
<li>Admin takes over or assists immediately</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Escalation Actions:</strong> - Admin may message you to understand situation - Task may be reassigned to available curator - Pattern of breaches → Performance review discussion</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="sla-best-practices">7.8.5 SLA Best Practices</h4>
<p><strong>Meeting Your SLAs:</strong> - ✅ Check queue at start of each work session - ✅ Process oldest items first (FIFO approach) - ✅ Use templates to speed up feedback - ✅ Set realistic capacity limits - ✅ Mark time-off to avoid assignments - ✅ Prioritize safety reports immediately - ✅ Communicate if overwhelmed (message Admin)</p>
<p><strong>When You Can’t Meet SLA:</strong> - ✅ Set yourself unavailable if overloaded - ✅ Notify Admin before SLA breach if possible - ✅ Request help or reassignment - ❌ Don’t let tasks sit unattended - ❌ Don’t rush and sacrifice quality</p>
<p><strong>Quality vs Speed:</strong> - SLA measures timeliness, not quality - Never sacrifice review quality for speed - A thorough review at 23 hours &gt; rushed review at 1 hour - Host feedback score matters equally to SLA compliance</p>
